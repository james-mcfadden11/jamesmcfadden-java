        <h3>Famous Quotes</h3>
        <p>"Donâ€™t dig in against Bob Gibson, he'll knock you down. He'd knock down his own grandmother if she dared to challenge him. Don't stare at him, don't smile at him, don't talk to him. He doesn't like it. If you happen to hit a home run, don't run too slow, don't run too fast. If you happen to want to celebrate, get in the tunnel first. And if he hits you, don't charge the mound, because he's a Gold Glove boxer. I'm like, damn, what about my seventeen-game hitting streak? That was the night it ended." - Hank Aaron</p>
        <p>"The two most important things in life: good friends and a strong bullpen." -Bob Gibson</p>
